# Simple Speech Recognizer using Convolutional Neural Network
CNN based Minimal model for recognizing word
Pre-Requisits - Python, Tensorflow,Keras, Librose installed.
Install Anaconda and create a seperate conda environment for development.
Then install Tensorflow,Keras,Librose in the newly created environment.
Run the Program using python filename.py

MFCC is a main feature of a sound signal. Using Librose we extract the MFCC into vectors. 

Actuall technology is using fourier series we conver the time domain repesentation of the signal to frequency domain.
Then we extracts the MFCC and reshape it to fit  to 2D matrix.

Then this pre-processed data is fed to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

You can put any set of audio files which needed to be predicted and used for training.
